# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch repository! This project is dedicated to providing Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms built entirely from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. 

This repository's implementations and concepts have been influenced and learned from the following valuable YouTube channels:

- [Pat Loeber's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@patloeber)

- [Sentdex's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)
